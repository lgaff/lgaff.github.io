Lindsay is an often bored software Engineer from Australia, who has too many interests, and an unfortunate tendency towards breadth-first approaches to learning things.

This part of the internet is a primarily a repository for anything useful I've found over the years on just about any subject, albeit with a heavy bias towards computers and their application.
