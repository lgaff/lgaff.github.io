# Linkers and Loaders

   - [Linkers and loaders - John R Levine](http://www.iecc.com/linker/)

      Note that this is the draft manuscript edition. The full print version is available [here](http://astore.amazon.com/theinvincibleele/detail/1558604960)

   - [GNU ld manual](http://www.eecs.umich.edu/courses/eecs373/readings/Linker.pdf)

      I'm not sure if this is the most recent version since it's part of EECS 373 at UMich. One day I should really track it down (most likely on [gnu.org](http://gnu.org).
