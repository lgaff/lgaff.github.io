## Libraries

   Some interesting graphics libraries are here.

- [Quil - a clojurescript library for programmatically creating visualisations](http://quil.info)

- [Shadertoy](https://shadertoy.com)

   A WebGL sandbox. WebGL works pretty much identical to GLSL shaders. Pretty useful to muck around with books like [GPU gems](https://developer.nvidia.com/gpugems/GPUGems/gpugems_pref01.html) without having to dive into a ton of C/C++ boilerplate.
