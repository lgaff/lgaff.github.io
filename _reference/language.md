# Learning new languages

I'm not sure why, but I *love* learning human languages. I've never really enjoyed speaking English for various reasons, I use it simply because I must.
But other languages I find to be extremely fun. In keeping with my breadth-first approach to mastery of the universe, I've dabbled, in some degree of depth with these languages:
 - Old English
 - Russian
 - German
 - Spanish
 - French
 - Arabic
 - Japanese
 - Swahili
 - Hebrew
 - Esperanto

 In recent times, I've tried to limit myself to just Russian and German, to try and attain fluency in at least one other language. These are bits of the Internet I have found useful while chasing my polyglottal dreams

## Learning ideas

- I find a useful idea for learning new languages is to keep a journal, and try to write an entry every day of what you did, but duplicated both in your native language, and in the language you're learning. Try to avoid using a diary that marks the date/day for you - write them in yourself. This encourages learning for common words. Try to include details like the weather, the time you woke up etc. Doing this gives practise in writing and constructing grammatically correct sentences (and not just making it sound like a transposition of the English), and encourages you to look up new words/phrases to build vocabulary.
