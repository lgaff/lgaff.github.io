# По-русский?

I've been learning Russian on and off since mid-2015. Despite the considerable length of time, I'm still at a fairly rudimentary level
since finding other humans I want to speak to in not-English is difficult.

That said, at this point I can comfortably read and write Cyrillic, and can typically muddle my way through the occasional medium-length
emails I receive from friends and coworkers to help me practise. Writing a reply usually takes longer, and I'm a mess at anything spoken in either direction.

These are bookmarks and Youtube channels I've found helpful for learning Russian.

# Keyboards

Unless you've got a keyboard with removable caps, mastering a Cyrillic keyboard is going to be extremely painful. Thankfully, there are options.
Linux, My Android phone, and I believe OSX all come with a phonetic layout that fairly accurately maps Cyrillic characters to their phonetic latin equivalents, with a few
quirks where the sounds don't overlap.

If you're on Windows though (and possibly iOS - I haven't had an iPhone since ~2009) You're a bit screwed without installing a third-party phonetic keyboard.
The best one I've found is on [this site](http://winrus.com/kbd_e.htm) (links are buried **wayyy** down the bottom, but the information is important). Install the student version (yaverty) for best compatibility between other phonetic variants.
