## Other people's book lists

   These are **enormous** categorised lists that others have assembled about computing. I've found them to be quite useful.
   Note that books I've found to be really useful may be duplicated in my own list.

# Books on programming

   These are books I've found especially useful

- [Practical Common Lisp](http://gigamonkeys.com/book)

   This book made OOP make sense for me. Granted, the CLOS is very different to most modern object systems, but the text has a practicality to it that is typically lacking from entry level 'a cat is a type of animal, animals can walk' descriptions of object systems that focus on inheritance instead of encapsulation and data-hiding.

- [Lisp](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1168499.Lisp)

   It's old, and the Lisp dialect it uses is long dead. But the substance of the book is most useful, and the code examples can usually be coerced into working in a modern lisp like CL or Clojure without too much fuss. I haven't yet managed to get the graphical ones to work - If anyone can recommend a useful library for simple bitmap manipulation, please let me know.

- [The art of assembly](http://www.plantation-productions.com/Webster/www.artofasm.com/index.html)

   Specifically, [this part](http://www.plantation-productions.com/Webster/www.artofasm.com/Windows/HTML/DigitalDesigna4.html#6138) was a penny-drop moment for me
   as far as understanding computers goes. I'm not sure how I avoided it for so long (we're talking c2006 here), but the discovery of feedback in a logic circuit blew my fucking mind.

- [Common lisp cookbook](https://lispcookbook.github.io/cl-cookbook/)

   I'm still going through this one, but it has the look of a complete documentation/guide more than a typical cookbook. Specifically, the section on data structures is most useful.
