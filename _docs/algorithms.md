- [NIST - dictionary of algorithms and data structures](https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/)

   A searchable list of practically every DS known on this planet. No pretty visualisations, but if you're looking for information, this will have it.

## Visualisations

   These resources come with some nice graphical descriptions of some common DSAs that help to illustrate their function.

      Also check out [D3.js](https://d3js.org), a really nice Javascript library for creating dynamic SVG visualisations in HTML

   - [VisuAlgo](http://visualgo.net)

   - [DSA Visualisations](http://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/Algorithms.html)

      More extensive than Mike Bostock's, but less descriptive.
